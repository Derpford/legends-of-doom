# Legends of Doom
A mod for GZDoom, inspired by Risk of Rain 2

## What?
This mod aims to implement mechanics and gameplay similar to Risk of Rain 2. In particular:

1. Damage values are based on your character's Power, multiplied by a scaling value. Your Power goes up when you level up, increasing all damage you do.
2. Weapon spawn spots contain Items, which grant passive effects of various kinds. Most of these are conditional in some way.

While I'm going to try and make the stuff in this mod as distinct as possible, there's definitely gonna be some items that are straight up borrowed from RoR2. (Things like Infusion or Focus Crystal are too good an idea to pass up.)

## Details

All characters have the following stats:

Power: All damage scales off of Power. The stats you gain from leveling up vary between characters, but everyone gains some Power when leveling up.

Precision: As your Precision increases, you get a chance of temporarily doubling your Power when calculating damage. Once you start consistently getting double Power, you can start rolling for triple power.

Toughness: As your Toughness increases, you get a chance of halving incoming damage. Like with Precision, once you get it high enough, you can start rolling for 1/3rd damage.

Luck: Modifies the chance of random rolls directly related to your character. However, it's capped at 50%. Or -50%, if you have *bad* luck...

Bonus Health: Most characters gain additional Health as they level up.
